The Dairy Den, a Cape Town dessert outlet has launched a project to say thank you to South Africa’s Essential Services workers at the front-lines of the Covid-19 pandemic, hopefully spreading a little happiness in the process. South Africans can now say, “thank you” by ordering boxes of cinnamon or chocolate donuts to be delivered straight to our Medics, Police and Fire Services. On Friday 8 May 2020 The Dairy Den delivered 300 donuts to Tygerberg Hospital as part of their Donuts for Doers campaign.  The donuts, which were donated by customers and matched by The Dairy Den were enjoyed by ICU nurses, doctors and cleaning staff. A further 50 donuts were donated to the officers and admin workers at the Sea Point police station and 20 donuts went to the fire-fighters at Sea Point Fire Station. Each box ordered will contain 6 donuts and The Dairy Den will donate the same number of boxes you order. They will also arrange a free, weekly delivery to essential services workers near their Sea Point and Kenilworth branches. “As support grows, we hope to add more essential services to our list of drop offs. There are so many people doing such incredible work and we want to show them how much we appreciate what they’re doing.” “The amazing, nightly cheer from our neighbourhood for the essential services workers inspired us to launch the campaign. We wanted to show our appreciation to the frontliners and to allow people to show their gratitude with something fun and tasty that would hopefully boost morale where it is needed most” said Tasia Donaldson of The Dairy Den. “We usually sell happiness, now we’re enabling South Africans to donate happiness too.” Both The Dairy Den branches (Sea Point and Kenilworth Centre) are open for deliveries only during Level 4 lockdown. Orders via UberEats, OrderIn or MrD. For more information visit www.thedairyden.com to be a part of the #DonutsForDoers project.
