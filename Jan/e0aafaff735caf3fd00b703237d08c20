It’s the height of Summer and you’re looking for an excuse to dress up in your elegant (and stylish) white attire, but nowhere to go. Why not join the Franschhoek Vignerons at this year’s Franschhoek Summer Wines for a spectacular garden party. The date is set for Saturday, 1 February at the magnificent Leopard’s Leap Family Vineyards and you don’t want to miss out on this exclusive event. The winemakers will be showcasing their choices for Summer, which include white, rosé, Méthode Cap Classique and lighter styled red wines. These have been carefully selected to match the hot Summer days. Complement your wines with seasonal-inspired food freshly prepared by Chef Pieter de Jager and his team. Relax on the sprawling lawn or in the comfort of the enclosed patio area of the venue. Live music will add the final touches to what promises to be the perfect day out in the Franschhoek Wine Valley.
