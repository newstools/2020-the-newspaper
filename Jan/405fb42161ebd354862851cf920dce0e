January is a wary start for all as we recuperate from all the festive (and overindulgent) celebrations. Despite our wounded wallets, Benguela Cove still offers a plethora of fun things to do without breaking the bank. One of the biggest drawing cards for this estate is the incredible views of the Bot River Lagoon with vistas of vineyards running down to the Atlantic Ocean. This alone will soothe the soul, but doing the free art walk might just trigger the creative juices you need to spark those 2020 initiatives. The monumental pieces created by Anton Smit can embody all your great plans for the year, so put it out there and try the millionaires pairing for a sweet beginning. This shortbread and caramel treat derived its name from the rich ingredients, complete with a sweet wine made from Viognier grapes. Try the Lighthouse Range that delivers on quality at affordable prices. The Moody Lagoon Red Blend received its “hidden gem” status in the 2020 Platter’s Wine Guide, adding the guarantee of extra bang for your buck. Wine tasting is free when you spend R150 or more and the cellar door platter is more than enough for three guests to nibble on. On 25 January, Andrew Young returns to the estate for another summer sunset performance. This internationally renowned saxophonist had guests on their feet at his 2019 show and promise another energetic performance. For those who prefer action to jazz, the Benguela Cove Adventure Day on 12 January will set the bar for all your new year’s resolutions. This swim-run event will be hosted in collaboration with Big Bay Events. And, as the month of love approaches, Benguela Cove has more fun up its sleeve with “Love is Blind” tastings that will put lovers to the test. For more information visit www.benguelacove.co.za
