If you’re needing a safe place to go with the family, visit Vadas Smokehouse & Bakery on Spier Wine Farm for their heart-warming dishes and ample space. Breakfast is served every Saturday and Sunday morning from 9 – 11am. You can enjoy farm-style delights including warm rolled oats, sourdough waffles, eggs benedict and the Farmer Angus breakfast of scrambled eggs, bacon, boerewors, mushrooms and toast. The bakery serves freshly baked croissants, sticky buns, sourdough bread and of course, their much-loved Pasteis de Nata! Open for lunch Monday – Sunday from 12 – 4pm, you can savour the new menu, which now includes their signature sourdough pizzas. Still serving their delicious smoked beef brisket and fire-grilled meats, there is plenty to choose from for both meat-lovers and vegetarians alike (the menu boasts a number of innovative veg dishes). A take-away menu is also on offer, as you find a perfect spot under an oak tree on the historic Spier Werf or stroll along the Eerste river. While at Spier, be sure to visit the newly transformed Spier farm shop to stock your pantry with delicious offerings. Frozen family-size pies, sourdough waffles, pizza bases, bread rolls and other Vadas goods are on sale; along with organic Spier vegetables, local chocolate, cheese and Farmer Angus meat products. The recently opened Elemental Garden, a refreshingly natural play area for the kids to enjoy, places Spier as a favourite for families – at any level!
