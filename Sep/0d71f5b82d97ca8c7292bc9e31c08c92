According to Cypriot Realty, it is very tempting for many South Africans to secure a 2nd citizenship or permanent residency status in another country. The main reason is personal: to assure their family’s future by protecting against political risk and economical instability. Europe is the world’s largest single market & global trading block and is still the preferred investment destination for either a 2nd citizenship or permanent residency. Cyprus, an English-speaking, ex-British colony and full EU member currently has the most attractive 2nd citizenship and permanent residency programmes available. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21040" src="https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web13.jpg" alt="Cypriot Realty" width="745" height="483" srcset="https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web13.jpg 745w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web13-696x451.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" />The Mediterranean lifestyle is about enjoying life to the full and Cyprus represents being a very popular investment, retirement & relocation destination for South Africans. Properties in Cyprus offer exceptional value for money when compared to other European countries – especially homes right on or near to The Med. The choice of where to buy is very personal and the type of property depends on your lifestyle requirements, your budget and also your short, medium & long term plans. The key benefit of buying a property in Cyprus to secure a Plan B and owning your slice of paradise, is that property investment automatically comes with either acquiring permanent residency or securing a 2nd citizenship, tangibly benefitting your family for generations to come: <img class="wp-image-21038 alignleft" src="https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web11.jpg" alt="Cypriot Realty" width="356" height="231" srcset="https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web11.jpg 745w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web11-696x451.jpg 696w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web11-741x483.jpg 741w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px" /> Citizenship is granted in 6 months via Cyprus’ “Citizenship through investment” programme: – It’s the quickest process in Europe; – all dependent children up to age 28 and the parents of the investor qualify; – it’s mainly an investment – not a donation; – the property/ies CAN be rented out; and need to be retained for only 5 years; – citizenship is passed down through descent offering a legacy to future generations. Permanent residency is granted in 2 months on the “Fast Track” programme – this is the only programme in Europe where 3 generations in the same family (including both the parents & in-laws) all acquire residency by buying one property! – dependent children up to 25 qualify; – the property can be rented out; – there is no requirement to live in Cyprus; nor be domiciled there for tax.<img class=" wp-image-21039 alignright" src="https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web12.jpg" alt="Cypriot Realty" width="314" height="203" srcset="https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web12.jpg 745w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web12-696x451.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /> Making the investment in Cyprus is simpler than you think; and the generous exemption of import duties, excise duties and VAT to bring your personal effects to Cyprus for your relocation makes it easy on the wallet too. More importantly both the residency and citizenship through investment programmes are tried, tested and trusted – they work! An astute offshore property investment that works for you in the short, medium and long term is the achievement of a lifetime. In Cyprus investing in the “Citizenship through Investment” or the Fast Track residency programme not only makes financial sense, but it will tangibly benefit your family for generations to come. Can you afford not to take advantage of this while the programmes are still open?
