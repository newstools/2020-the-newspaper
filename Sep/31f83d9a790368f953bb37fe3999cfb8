Cape Town has been nominated for the World Travel Awards for 2020 in numerous and diverse categories. “This is not by chance. Much hard work has gone into ensuring that our city is top of mind as a destination of choice, no matter what you are looking for. In 2018, tourism added roughly R18,1 billion to our local economy and directly supported just over 113 000 jobs. This is why tourism remains a priority sector for the City of Cape Town. As a part of our Tourism Bounce Back Strategy, the City’s Enterprise and Investment Department is hard at work on a Six Pillar Strategy and that will position Cape Town as the premier destination in which to Live, Play, Work, Study, Visit or Invest. I am confident that together the City of Cape Town’s official Destination Marketing Organisation, Cape Town Tourism, and the Tourism Bounce Back strategy we have developed, we can breathe life back into the tourism industry and plot a sustainable and inclusive future for this vital and vibrant sector,” – Mayoral Committee Member for Economic Opportunities and Asset Management, Alderman James Vos. The Mother City has been nominated in the following categories: Vote to ensure our city gets the recognition it deserves. Voting closes on 24 September 2020.
