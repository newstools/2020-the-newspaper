A mask wearing, supersized art installation of Irma Stern’s The Initiate, the prized artwork taking pride of place at Tryn, Steenberg’s signature restaurant, is part of a novel COVID-19 fund raising initiative to assist students at Stellenbosch University. The masked rendition of the Irma Stern portrait can be seen outside the GUS gallery in Dorp Street, as one of a number of Masked Masterpieces on display in the university town. This powerful outdoor collection of famous South African artworks with masks superimposed in supersized format is funded entirely by the private sector and is on display until December at significant sites around Stellenbosch. The Irma Stern installation was made possible by Beck Family Philanthropy. As custodians of Steenberg, the Beck family’s love of South African art is evident in the farm’s notable collection. I Irma Stern, one of South Africa’s most celebrated artists who achieved national and international acclaim during her lifetime, painted The Initiate in 1935. The artists’ stories are displayed on plaques alongside the installations for the duration of Masked Masterpieces with information about the works, where the originals can be viewed and how to make a donation towards a student bursary via SnapScan or EFT. The donations will be administered by Stellenbosch University and will assist in funding bursaries for students impacted by COVID-19, studying at the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.
