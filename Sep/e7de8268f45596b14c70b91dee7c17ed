An hour’s drive south of Cape Town past Stellenbosch and Franschhoek, on the way to the coastal town of Hermanus lies the Overberg town on Grabouw. The town is surrounded by the Hottentot Hollands, Kogelberg and Groenberg mountain ranges to form the cool mountain plateau of the Elgin Valley. And situated on the south eastern side of this Valley, lies South Hill Vineyards. The Elgin Valley is fast becoming known for its top cool climate producing wine route, romantic destination wedding region and as the outdoor adventure capital of South Africa. A background in hospitality and property development and a huge passion for wine, prompted the King family to create this contemporary, accessible, boutique wine farm. Since buying the farm in 2000, Kevin and Sandy King have developed South Hill Vineyards into a producer of delicious cool climate wines and offer a unique guest farm experience with luxury accommodation including a Scandi-style House Boat, wedding and function venue, art gallery, restaurant and one of a kind Vineyard maze. Together with their dedicated team, they invite you to visit South Hill Vineyards and enjoy this unique offering. Open 7 days a week for wine sales; restaurant and art gallery open Friday – Monday, for breakfast from 08h00 and lunches until 16h00. For more information visit www.southhill.co.za
