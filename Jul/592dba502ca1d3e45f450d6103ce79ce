At a time when local wineries need the support of the public, Benguela Cove Lagoon Wine Estate has set up a fun, free online webinar series, so anyone can enjoy an expert wine tasting in the comfort and safety of their own home. There is a series of six weekly webinars, starting on July 2nd, to be enjoyed with a bottle of Benguela Cove wine that you can order by the case in advance with the vineyard’s click and collect service. During each hour-long tasting, visitors can join cellar master winemaker Johann Fourie virtually, live from the vineyards. It is an opportunity, Johann says, to find out more about wines and wine appreciation. He will share his expertise, with tips on how to enjoy the very best from a glass of white, red, rose or bubbly, with advice on subjects such as storing wine, glassware and pairing with food for maximum flavour and enjoyment. The cellar master will be joined by celebrity chef Jean Delport. He won a prestigious Michelin Star at Restaurant Interlude in 2019, in less than one year since the venue opened at Leonardslee Lakes and Gardens in Sussex, England. It is a sister estate to the Benguela Cove vineyard, which are both owned by entrepreneur Penny Streeter. “A popular choice are the private online wine tastings that anyone can book for birthdays, anniversaries and other special events. It’s a virtual party experience that you can share with friends and relations, wherever they are located,” says Penny Streeter. For more information visit www.benguelacove.co.za
