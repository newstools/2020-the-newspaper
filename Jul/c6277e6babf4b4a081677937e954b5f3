Keeping up with our overseas neighbours as the world gets closer is not as easy as it looks, with inspiration overload from Pinterest and your pinboard overflowing with great ideas.
The reality sinks in as you breath out, your dreams remain a dream as you know it is not available in South Africa and if it is, the price tag is out of reach based on our current exchange rate. As South Africa has grown in the decor and design field over the years, owning our own unique flair for creativity and a way of life that cannot be matched anywhere else in the world is earning us recognition as a design capital by our neighbours. This is definitely something positive to focus on, the demand for designer furniture has increased and so has the rise in local production with an expectation for quality furniture which in turn is sustaining growth in our beautiful country. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18901" src="https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TNP0720_web36-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1660" srcset="https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TNP0720_web36-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TNP0720_web36-768x498.jpg 768w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TNP0720_web36-1536x996.jpg 1536w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TNP0720_web36-2048x1328.jpg 2048w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TNP0720_web36-696x451.jpg 696w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TNP0720_web36-1068x693.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /> Tucked away in Stellenbosch, an industry secret that will take your breath away, a family owned and run business focused on bespoke furniture manufacturer, celebrating their thirtieth year in business.
