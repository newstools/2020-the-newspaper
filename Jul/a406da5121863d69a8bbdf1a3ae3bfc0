You’re Welcome Gift Boxes, a Cape Town company was born in 2019 with the purpose of offering customers a new gift shopping experience, something contrary to the norm.  Today they deliver gift boxes all over South Africa. “We took a two-folded approach to target the areas which needed some innovative energy and offered opportunity. The concept is moulded around creating convenience in a hustle & bustle lifestyle, where time flies, and, before you know it, you’ve forgotten to get someone that special gift.” You’re Welcome Gift Design has curated the elements required to create an exceptional gift. The content within the gift boxes are sourced from local artisans far and wide. Their motivation draws from their desire to share the discovery of South African entrepreneurs who crafted remarkable masterpieces, which you would not normally find around every corner. “We have taken these discoveries, and placed them in branded gift boxes, especially wrapped for our customers.” You’re Welcome Gift Design has many gift ideas as well as item combinations ready for you to select from. You can choose between different categories: For her, For Him, For the Kitchen, Newborn and kids, Beverages, On the Move and Social vibes.
