The Toeka story reveals a unique and undiscovered gem in the Winelands for all who loves antiques, vintage items and beautiful things from yesteryear. It is a result of the owners, Johan and Gesie van Deventer’s passion in collecting and preserving the beautiful things of yesteryear, and to share it with everyone in a very impressive display. Toeka is situated on the Domaine Brahms Wine estate, a picturesque working farm near Paarl, with a beautiful Wedding venue, chapel and winery. Toeka takes you down memory lane with antique tractors, vintage cars and farm equipment, antique furniture, vintage household items, clothes and toys as well as an array of collector’s items. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18910" src="https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TNP0720_web6-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1660" srcset="https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TNP0720_web6-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TNP0720_web6-768x498.jpg 768w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TNP0720_web6-1536x996.jpg 1536w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TNP0720_web6-2048x1328.jpg 2048w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TNP0720_web6-696x451.jpg 696w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TNP0720_web6-1068x693.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /> Of special interest to collectors will be the antique steam engine, many old railway memorabilia, some special John Deere tractors, restored and unrestored, Fordson, a perfectly restored Lance bulldog tractor, iron wheel tractors, beautiful well restored vintage cars, including a Willys that belonged to Johan’s granddad, 2 Ford Prefects, a 1948 Austin, not to mention the many dinky toy cars for young and old to admire!
