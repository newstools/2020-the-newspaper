Situated in the heart of the Stellenbosch Winelands is where you’ll find Middelvlei Wines, which has been owned and run by the Momberg family since 1919. This is where you will also get to indulge in the popular Boerebraai lunch, a unique outdoor barbecue experience.  An integral part of our South African heritage, the team at Middelvlei have taken this social event to the next level. Their resident braai expert prepares your chops, boerewors and chicken kebabs to perfection, as you sit back and relax. The enticing aromas of the homemade potbrood and braaibroodjies give you a sneak peek of what lies ahead for your foodie experience, whilst Ben Momberg’s homemade pâté and Ouma Annie’s pumpkin fritters have placed the Middelvlei Boerebraai experience in a league of their own. Make the most of the perfect Cape weather and sit outside on the sprawling verandah whilst admiring the views. On colder days the cozy fireplace inside will add extra warmth. The ample space makes for a safe visit for the entire family with Covid-19 health regulations in place, to ensure a memorable experience. The Boerebraai experience includes a starter and main course and is available to enjoy on Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays between 12pm and 3pm. A low carb and vegetarian option are also available.
