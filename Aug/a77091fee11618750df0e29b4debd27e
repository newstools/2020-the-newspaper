The Nedbank Cape Winemakers Guild Auction goes live and online this year, offering wine enthusiasts and collectors the opportunity to bid on current CWG Auction Wines and exceedingly rare previous CWG Auction gems from members’ personal vinotheques. There will be two separate and distinct auctions in 2020 and both will be hosted by international auction house Bonhams. The CWG Vinotheque Auction hosted by Bonhams will feature small collections of past CWG Auction wines perfectly stored in the Guild members’ private cellars. All funds raised will be placed in a trust to help winemakers keep their businesses afloat in the aftermath of Covid-19 in order to continue employing those who depend on an income from the wine industry. Bidders will be able to place their bids on the Bonham’s website over a two-week period from Friday, 18 September 2020 until 16:00 (London time) on Saturday, 3 October 2020.

Following President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision to declare a National State of Disaster, all indicators show that the regulations which prohibit all social gatherings will continue to remain in force for some time to come. As the health of those around us is our number one priority, the CWG has cancelled all local public events for the remainder of 2020. The Guild looks forward to hosting its public events in 2021.
