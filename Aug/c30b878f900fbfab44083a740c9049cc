Dr. Jana Wurz, Registered homeopath, has recently relocated to the Western Cape after completing her studies in Johannesburg. She is looking forward to providing holistic healthcare to adults and children. She is working from her practice and also remotely, via online platforms such as Skype, Zoom and MSTeams. Background Dr Wurz grew up in Somerset West and studied Human Physiology at Stellenbosch University, where she completed a Master’s degree investigating the molecular effects of ketone bodies on neuronal cells, research relevant to Alzheimer’s disease. Then she made the decision to change direction and moved to Johannesburg to study homeopathy at the University of Johannesburg. ‘I felt the need to follow a more holistic path and homeopathy was ideal’, says Wurz. What is Homeopathy? Homeopathy is a health system developed in Germany over 200 years ago and is based on the principle of ‘like cures like’, meaning that a substance which produces symptoms in a healthy person cures those same symptoms in disease. Homeopathy forms part of an integrated health approach which means that it works well combined with other healing modalities such as ‘mainstream’ allopathic medicine or other ‘alternative’ paths of healing. It is known as a gentle healing approach, safe to be used by children and during pregnancy under the supervision of a homeopath. Homeopaths are given the title ‘doctor’ due to their skills as diagnosticians. <img class="wp-image-21053 alignright" src="https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web26.jpg" alt="Health" width="284" height="184" srcset="https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web26.jpg 745w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web26-696x451.jpg 696w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web26-741x483.jpg 741w" sizes="(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px" /> To become a homeopath, a five- to seven-year rigorous training course has to be completed. Dr Wurz’s Masters dissertation in homeopathy involved an experimental approach to test homeopathic remedies, alone and combined with low level laser treatment, in the context of diabetic wound healing, which had promising results. Her approach is based on individualised treatment, and patients are viewed as a multifaceted whole. ‘I really enjoy getting to know patients as everyone has a unique life story,’ says Wurz. She is passionate about Homeopathy and holistic health and wants to improve health and well-being, taking into account people’s unique life experiences, circumstances and challenges. No two people are alike, which is why personalised treatment is so valuable, in her opinion. <img class=" wp-image-21037 alignleft" src="https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web10.jpg" alt="Health" width="231" height="150" srcset="https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web10.jpg 745w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web10-696x451.jpg 696w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web10-741x483.jpg 741w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /> Homeopathy – an alternative approach to health People that visit homeopaths or other holistic practitioners often feel that they have tried everything and begin to despair of recovering. Contemporary homeopathy is based on age-old principles combined with modern functional medicine, a systems-biology approach which works with the root cause of illness which is usually multifactorial. What also may be missing in their treatment regime is someone really listening to them as a person and spending the time to puzzle out where their illness is originating from, not neglecting the very important emotional and psychological aspect of their being. In addition, holistic healthcare empowers a person to work alongside their doctor in a partnership, which empowers them to take control of their own health. Indeed, a client or patient is the expert on their bodies and of their own experience which places them in the ideal position to actively participate in their own healing. This could include implementing lifestyle changes which is vital in not only preventing disease but in achieving optimum health and well-being. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21055" src="https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web28.jpg" alt="Health" width="745" height="483" srcset="https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web28.jpg 745w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TNP0820_web28-696x451.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" /> Remote Consultations Many might be wondering how remote consultations work. After booking an appointment at a convenient time, Dr Wurz will connect with her client via her/his chosen online platform e.g. Skype. Then she will take a full case history, as would be done in the practice, finding out the client’s health concerns, as well as their general well-being and advising them where there might be uncertainty or a desire to change their lifestyle. After that Dr Wurz will select the indicated remedy/remedies and courier it to the client’s location, or arrange for them to collect it from the practice. Payment will be via EFT or another platform. During the Covid-19 pandemic the Allied Health Professions Council (AHPCSA) advised its members to practice telemedicine (as explained above) as this reduces close contact and decreases the risk of infection for all involved. It is also quite convenient as the consultation can be done from your own home where you feel comfortable. Dr Wurz is someone that is devoted to helping the people that come to her for help, and is willing to go the extra mile to research their condition to aim to really understand their illness or difficulty. “It is a privilege to work with people and to devise a treatment plan that is unique to them,” Wurz said. “I am here to help.” For more information contact Dr Wurz on 072 285 1230, email: drjanawurz@gmail.com or visit www.drjanawurz.wixsite.com/mysite-1
