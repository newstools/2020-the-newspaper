Many private sector entities and government departments have announced financial support for businesses struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown, but it is very difficult for companies to navigate the various packages available. To help companies to understand the support they can access, the Western Cape Government, City of Cape Town and Wesgro have today launched a fund location tool for businesses called the COVID-19 Support Finder. Available now on the COVID-19 Content Centre, the tool asks the user 5 easy questions, ranks the answers against pre-determined criteria as stipulated by the various relief measures, and provides a list of relief measures the business may be applicable for. The process takes under a minute. The tool is one of the support offerings of the COVID-19 Content Centre, which to date has had over 12 000 visitors, contains 130 FAQs (as asked by Western Cape businesses), and has assisted over 800 people with direct inquiries sent through to supportbusiness@wesgro.co.zadocument.getElementById("wpmt-896245-489069").innerHTML = eval(decodeURIComponent("%27%73%75%70%70%6f%72%74%62%75%73%69%6e%65%73%73%40%77%65%73%67%72%6f%2e%63%6f%2e%7a%61%27"))*protected email*. The site was launched prior to the nationwide lockdown, serving as a dedicated online portal to the latest government regulations and inspiring stories of business innovation and best practice. Supported by a virtual team of sectorial and communication specialists, the dedicated team assists businesses in real-time by simplifying complex government legislature. “The lockdown is essential to stop the spread of COVID-19, but we know that times are tough for business. That is why, now more than ever, we want to support businesses by giving them trusted information that will help them get through this, stay safe and stay resilient. The COVID-19 Support Finder is one of many ways that we’re helping businesses access some of the financial relief by making the range of both government and private sectors funds available through an easy-to-use online tool.” said Minister of Finance and Economic Opportunities, David Maynier. Alderman James Vos, Mayoral Committee Member for Economic Opportunities and Asset Management within the City of Cape Town, added: “Our world has been turned upside down by the COVID-19 global pandemic. There are no quick fixes and one thing is clear, this crisis calls for innovation and smart solutions. One of the biggest challenges we face currently is a lack of clarity on where to go to get help. The launch of the Support Finder is therefore very exciting and provides business with access to the information they need, fast. By providing this service, we are working to ensure businesses are able to weather this storm.” “We’re here to help businesses in Cape Town and the Western Cape navigate the complex funding environment in a unique and user-friendly way, including assistance from the Investment Promotion team within Wesgro. Together with our government partners, we will constantly keep the tool up-to-date to help companies adapt in this time of crisis,” concluded Wesgro CEO, Tim Harris.
