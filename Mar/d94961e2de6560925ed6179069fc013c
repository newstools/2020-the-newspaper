While several major international events have confirmed cancellation amidst fears of the global spread of the COVID-19 virus, Reed Exhibitions South Africa would like to advise that there are no plans to cancel ILTM or WTM Africa in Cape Town, running 2-8 April 2020. “While ITB Berlin was cancelled this past Friday, we have based our decision on the fact that our exhibitors fall outside of high-risk COVID-19 areas,” says Megan Oberholzer, Portfolio Director: Travel, Tourism & Sports Portfolio for Reed Exhibitions South Africa. “That being said, in terms of International Buyers, attendees from China, Korea, Iran, and Italy will no longer be visiting ILTM or WTM Africa 2020, in the interests of health and safety”. While attendees from these four countries will no longer be attending ILTMA and WTMA 2020, Reed Exhibitions South Africa is replacing these attendees to waitlisted Buyers from other countries, who have subsequently taken them up. This will help ensure that exhibitors at the event will still enjoy a successful show. “We will continue to monitor all areas and the relative Buyer origins on a daily basis. Additional hygiene precautions have been put in place, including the placement of alcohol-based hand sanitisers and tissues throughout the venue,” says Oberholzer. “Reed Exhibitions takes our exhibitors’, buyers’, visitors’ and staff’s wellbeing extremely seriously and the measures put in place are all geared towards ensuring the health and safety of all attending the event”. ILTM Africa takes place at Moyo, Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden from 2-4 April.
