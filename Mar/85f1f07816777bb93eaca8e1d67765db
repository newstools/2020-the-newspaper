The second Homegrown Expo, which focuses on authentic, home-grown finds, will take place from 5 – 8 March at Canal Walk, Century City. Located at the epicentre, the Centre Court, the Expo will feature products including clothing, ceramics, décor, jewellery, furniture and more. Says Expo Organiser, Miriam Vallie: “We’re so excited to host our second Homegrown Expo at Canal Walk after our first successful event at Tyger Valley Centre last year. We’re blown away by the talent and entrepreneurship of our exhibitors, who have all been handpicked, and strongly believe local entrepreneurs should be given the opportunity to introduce their products to the market. There is no better place to do so than Canal Walk! ” Fellow organiser, Lee-Ann McNulty, adds that there will be something for everyone. “From handmade ceramics to bespoke baby rooms, custom-made furniture to handcrafted macramé, lifestyle accessories and jewellery, the Expo promises to offer visitors the opportunity to get to know and support local design and crafts. Whilst the product range is broad, they are all heart made with pride, lovingly displayed and sold by the business owner, creative or maker.” Vanessa Herbst, Marketing Manager at Canal Walk, adds: “We look forward to hosting the Home Grown Expo for the first time at Canal Walk and are excited at the prospect of merging the creativity of these exhibitors with the brands already on offer at Canal Walk,” Vallie concludes: “When you support handmade, you’re not only supporting a person, small business, family, and our economy. You’re also purchasing a small part of an artist’s heart. Be sure not to miss this exciting, one-of-a-kind event.”
