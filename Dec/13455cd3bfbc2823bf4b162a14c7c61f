The Sports Science Institute of South Africa (SSISA) is internationally recognised as a leader in the field of sport science. In 2019, the Sports Science Institute of South Africa launched its campus-based, SETA accredited one-year certificate and two-year diploma in personal training and conditioning. 2020 has seen continued growth, with the institute running at full capacity as the diploma students entered their second year and SSISA welcomed a new intake of first year students. For the Sports Science Institute, the challenges of 2020 have provided the opportunity for innovation and change.
Through its partners located across the country, SSISA’s distance learning qualifications will enable the student to benefit from the same learning material, additional resources, lecturer presentations, assessments as well as practical instruction and access to specialist equipment used in their campus-based courses. “It is critically important that our qualifications are standardised across all modes of delivery, campus-based and distance learning, as well as in all centres in order for our students to leave our institution with knowledge and skills that will set them apart, in what has fast become a competitive industry,” said Cathy Foden who is heading up SSISA’s distance learning. The health, wellness and sport performance industry continue to grow exponentially, and there are numerous opportunities for a career in health and fitness centres, schools and sports clubs. In addition, those with an entrepreneurial outlook will learn the skills needed to start their own venue-based or online business. “The launch of these distance learning qualifications provides all students in South Africa with the opportunity to study through our renowned institution where experts provide insight into fitness, strength and conditioning.”
