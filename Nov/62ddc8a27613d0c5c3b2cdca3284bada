In May, Mayoral Committee Member for Economic Opportunities and Asset Management, Alderman James Vos, visited green SMMEs, observing all health and safety protocols, with GreenCape, one of the Cityâ€™s Strategic Business Partners in the catalytic green economy sector. The purpose of these visits was to offer support to green SMMEs, making sure that the City supports the continued investment and job creation in the green economy. Five months later, these businesses are still going strong. One of the visits was to SolarMD, a local manufacturing company that specialises in commercial and industrial Lithium-Ion battery storage solutions. Since May, Solar MD has implemented a range of growth strategies, essentially doubling in factory size and introducing two more laser-welding machines increasing their daily output production to 800kWh. SolarMD currently has a strong order book of 11MWh on pre-paid solutions, with more orders constantly streaming in. This amounts to approximately 3 000 of its smaller battery packs, indicating that demand for energy storage products is growing substantially in the region. Another green SMME that formed part of the visit in May is SustainSolar, who manufacture turnkey and modular containerised solar solutions for off-grid applications. Since the site visit in May, they have been able to export one of their Sustain Extended turn-key solutions from their workshop in Cape Town to Uganda. Sustain Power was also awarded the globally recognised Solar Impulse Foundation Efficient Solutions Label, one of the first South African companies to have been awarded this honour.
