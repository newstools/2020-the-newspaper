If you’re looking for adventure just off the beaten track this summer, then head west! West Coast Way is a uniquely South African road trip that offers 101 stops sure to get your heart going again. Seasoned adventurers can forge their own way along a variety of trails that head north up the coast, cut east through the Cederberg or south along the beaches of Langebaan.
For those who are new to the region, West Coast Way now has a ‘basket’ of free themed routes on offer that take the guesswork out of your trip. “We highly recommend the Foodie Route, Cultural Route, Wild Route, as well as the newly launched Cape Way Route – all of which are designed to showcase the many attractions and activities that are already on offer on the Cape West Coast and inland areas but many may not yet know.” So, whether you’re looking to immerse yourself in the region’s rich San heritage at !Khwa ttu, tough it out on a trail run, make a splash kayaking, or even just get out of the city for some stunning bird watching, the West Coast Way is the way to go!
