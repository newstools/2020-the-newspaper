February is the hottest month in the Cape and while the summer sun is doing its part, the Winelands are turning up the heat with a plethora of offerings to spark a flame for those in search of a special place to celebrate their love. Benguela Cove Lagoon Wine Estate is known for its Lagoon Cruises on the Bot River lagoon in a covered pontoon, fondly named Lady Bonnie. A slight wind is a welcome addition here to take in the fresh air rolling in from the Atlantic. This is a brilliant start to the day for anyone planning to spend a full day at the estate. Top of the list is Valentineâ€™s Dinner Experience on 14 February at R550 per person. Chef Annie Badenhorst is a wizard when it comes to flavour combinations and to honour this day, she created a 5-course menu, perfectly paired with estate wines. T he romance is introduced with a refreshing Gazpacho starter with confit prawn, vinegar pearls, sauce Vierge and basil. Slowly turning up the heat, this is followed by a Turmeric risotto, rich, beef fat braised baby carrots, pickled sultanas, smoked yoghurt and orange. As for mains, a delicious cut of beef sirloin is served with colours of beetroot, radish, celery, pickled onion, potato and pomegranate jus. And to wrap it up with some sweetness, you can offer your partner the first bite of Litchi and cucumber Turkish delight cheesecake with rose and coconut custard. Off course there are more activities to enjoy at the estate before the dinner, or you can enjoy a picnic and cellar tour to experience the harvest activities. The cellar door platters remain a favourite, as well as the wholesome Sunday brunches. If you are treating your loved one to a weekend in the Overberg, join the Benguela Cove team the next day on 15 February for a rock and roll celebration featuring a Benguela Cove favourite, Cloud 9. Tickets are available online from Webtickets or at the Benguela Cove gift shop. For more information visit www.benguelacove.co.za
