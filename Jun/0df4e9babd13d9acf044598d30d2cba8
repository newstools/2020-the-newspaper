Nini Jerman, the entrepreneurial woman behind the Winston & Julia chocolate brand and the  newly released Stir! it Up range of natural cooking sauces has announced that she will be moving both her chocolate and sauce kitchens to Stellenbosch Agri-Park and close to the N2 , the Cape Town Film Studios, Spier and other popular wine farms. “We are moving into a really beautiful setting,” says Jerman. “It’s an old farm house, which faces the Eerste Rivier, that I will convert into a shop and from which I will sell my Winston & Julia Chocolates and Stir! it up sauces.” Besides the shop, Jerman is also planning to use the venue to run fun chocolate workshops, hold chocolate pairing events – with coffee, rooibos tea, wine, etc. and host corporate, hen and children’s parties. “Hopefully, we can start all these fun activities as soon as we are allowed to be in contact with others again,” says Jerman. Winston & Julia chocolates can be ordered online at https://winstonandjulia.co.za/ and Stir! it up sauces from www.stir-it-up.co.za.
