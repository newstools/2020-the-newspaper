The organizers of last year’s successful Knysna Film Festival have rebranded the festival to GRIFF – Garden Route International Film Festival. ‘In light of the current Covid19 pandemic we had to change our concept for the short term to ensure the festival goes ahead. To this end we are bringing back Drive-ins to the Garden Route and also taking the festival Online as a Virtual Festival’ says Patrick Walton GRIFF Festival Director. The organizers have already completed a recce of suitable locations in Riversdale, Mosselbay, George, Knysna, Plettenberg Bay, Calitzdorp, Ladysmith and Oudtshoorn. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18791" src="https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Depositphotos_12287654_xl-2015-Copy.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="552" srcset="https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Depositphotos_12287654_xl-2015-Copy.jpg 800w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Depositphotos_12287654_xl-2015-Copy-768x530.jpg 768w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Depositphotos_12287654_xl-2015-Copy-218x150.jpg 218w, https://thenewspaper.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Depositphotos_12287654_xl-2015-Copy-696x480.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />The organizers are taking this two-tier approach in order to ensure that the festival goes ahead in a Virtual environment and physical space. If Covid19 levels disrupt plans for the Drive-ins, postponement is easy with all the necessary planning already in place. The Drive-in Cinemas will feature a double bill for two nights in each town. A film in competition and an ‘Oldy but a goodie’ will be screened each night. Organizers anticipate that due to the limited number of cars allowed under gathering restrictions, tickets will be a sought-after commodity. Post festival, the organizers anticipate continuing with the drive-ins, creating an opportunity for individuals to create a business around the concept. ‘We have the equipment and infrastructure, so we want it out there for audiences to enjoy and take advantage of long after the festival finishes.’ says Festival Coordinator Shianne Maritz. Safety remains the number one priority so audiences will enjoy films from the comfort of their own cars. Depending on the level of Covid19 over the festival dates, there may also be some additional nostalgic services on offer. The organizers showed their creative and innovative thinking with the film festival last year and are intent on stepping things up a gear this year. Tickets will go on sale a month prior to the event and depending on the venue and restrictions at the time, up to 60 cars per venue are anticipated. We want people to enjoy this form of socializing and remember the hey-days of the drive-in experience and share that as a family. More information will be available on the festival website and Facebook page as planning continues. The Virtual film festival is scheduled for 21st September 2020 to 11th October 2020.
