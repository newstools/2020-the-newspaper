Tourlane is a carbon–neutral travel company and is passionate about sustainable travel.  Data was gathered from hundreds of cities across the globe and took into account accessibility, green space, the ratio of tourists to locals and air quality to determine the best cities in the world for sustainable travel. ‘We are delighted that Cape Town was recognised as one of the world’s eco-friendly travel destinations. More and more visitors are looking for environmentally friendly destinations and authentic experiences and this accolade demonstrates Cape Town’s commitment to sustainable practices,’ said Alderman Vos. Sustainability in tourism means implementing measures that will help minimise the impact of travel on the environment while preserving the local conditions for future generations. ‘Simply put, it creates better places for people to live in and better places to visit. A significant, and growing, number of tourists are looking for a better experience, a better quality product, and the City’s newly adopted Tourism Development Framework will focus on these approaches because it will drive demand and make business sense,’ said Alderman Vos. Cape Town is the only South African city on the list. The only other African cities to make the list are Nairobi in Kenya and Marrakech in Morocco.
